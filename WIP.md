# Work in Progress

## Next big step(s)

- True juice optimization for success chance
- Books & scroll calculations
- Juice / Book / Scroll purchase & chest openinig optimization

## Other features

- Automatic Market price integration(via some kind of API, or just updating the site at a regular interval automatically)
- Confidence intervals(might have to actually learn some math first)
- Allow selling mats

## UI

- Better roster tracking & income estimation(I don't think automatic game-to-website input is possible, but something like a generic 1680 income would be nice, need information/data on this)
- Input arithmetic parsing(e.g. allow inputs like 25*1234 for easier boxes calculation)
- Ctrl z, delete
- Hover question mark tooltips for various systems, but still aim to be intuitive
- Adjustable week number in raw / Gold graph
- Achieved ilevel
- Something seems to be broken in drag-to-select spreadsheetgrid
- Artisan level editing

## DEV

- MUCH more tests, specifically:
- Test countfailure non-naive version actually works
- Test average tap and ~~truncated average tap~~
- Test Tap map generator(and improve it maybe)

- Matrix operation libraries to speed up monte carlo and what not?
- Graph is off by 0.5 all the time, and the points of interest snap the the one below(i tihnk?) which isnt quite right idk, kinda scared to touch it
- better input cleaning for spreadsheetgrids
- make get_one_tap_pity take in seeded rng
- cache using array buffer? dont know if it's worth the effort
- fix the react stuff, i think there's way too much usememo(the website feels sluggish)
- improve how the cost estimation works / verify that it actually works

## Done / cancelled

- ~~Pre-compute prob_dist of groups of upgrades(such as +n all 5 armours etc)~~ not possible with juice being a thing i think
- ~~make longtermresult debounce use the universal function~~
- ~~Allow beamsearch to go below min indices(allow selling materials)~~
- ~~Improve beam search algorithm.~~
- ~~Sort out input parsing (clamping) for desired_chance, prolly make a new variable~~
- ~~Test beamsearch actually finding the best index(or close enough)~~
- ~~Better juice usage recommendation and value estimation to answer - Should I buy juice? How should I use juice~~
- ~~Test bitset success count evaluations~~
- ~~Optimize how chance_to_chance works~~
- ~~Juice box opening optimization(do i open for red or blue)~~
- ~~maybe go back to caching results?DEFINITELY caching the monte carlo + orcale bitsets~~
- ~~Budget needed estimation -> merge chance & budget mode~~
