# Advanced honing

Advanced honing is too complex to simulate at run time, so we ran some trials and used those as the probability distribution. So every +10 segment is treated as a single pull of how many taps was required(and how many juice were used). The (very vibe coded) python scripts used to generate the data was included in case they're needed.

Also included data.json here for no particular reason, it's what the javacsript used to read from, all values have since been hard coded into constants.rs
