# Advanced honing

Advanced honing is too complex to simulate at run time, so we ran some trials and used those as the probability distribution. So every +10 segment is treated as a single pull of how many taps was required(and how many juice were used). The (very vibe coded) python scripts used to generate the data was included in case they're needed.
