# Advanced honing

## I plan to replace this soon to allow for optimization of strategies(states) for AH

Advanced honing is too complex to simulate at run time, so we ran some trials and used those as the probability distribution. So every +10 segment is treated as a single pull of how many taps was required and how many juice were used. These (very vibe coded) python scripts were used to generate the data (which are hard coded in constants.rs).
