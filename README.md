# Honing Forecast

The [Maxroll upgrade calculator](https://maxroll.gg/lost-ark/upgrade-calculator) gives us a rough estimate on how much mats we need to pass certain upgrades, however it only gives the best, average and worst scenarios - this calculator works out everything in between.

Try it on the [website](https://kenivia.github.io/Honing-Forecast/)!

## WIP

### FEATURES

- Incorporate roster income tracking
- Book support
- Variance calculation & confidence interval

### DEV

- Write actual tests and also comment
- Get silver unlock cost somewhere(currently silver unlock cost is 0 so its labeled as WIP)(somewhere = maxroll probably)

### UI

- Make the percent sign follow the input number?(right now it just trails on the right)
- mobile dragging?
- maybe add tabs to switch between different functionalities
- ctrl z support, fix backspace & delete
